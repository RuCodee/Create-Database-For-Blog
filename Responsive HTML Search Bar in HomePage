To implement a search functionality for your HTML article pages, you would need to use a combination of HTML, PHP, and possibly other technologies depending on your specific requirements. Here's a general overview of what you might need:

1) HTML form with a search bar: You can create an HTML form with a search bar where users can enter their search queries. The form should be submitted to a PHP script that will handle the search functionality.
Example HTML code for a search bar:

________________________________________________________________
<form action="search.php" method="get">
  <input type="text" name="q" placeholder="Search...">
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
________________________________________________________________

2) PHP script to handle search queries: You'll need a PHP script to handle the search queries submitted by users. The script should take the user's search query and search through your HTML article pages based on the query.
Example PHP code for handling search queries:
________________________________________________________________
<?php
// Get the user's search query from the form submission
$q = $_GET['q'];

// Search through your HTML article pages based on the search query
// You can use a variety of techniques to search through the pages,
// such as regular expressions or a search library like Elasticsearch

// Display the search results to the user
// You can format the results as a list of links to the matching article pages,
// or you can display a preview of each article with the matching keywords highlighted
?>

3) Retrieving HTML article pages by tags and title: To retrieve your HTML article pages based on tags or keywords in the title, you'll need to have some way of storing and organizing the metadata for your articles. One common approach is to use a database to store the article metadata, such as the title, tags, and content. You can then query the database to retrieve the relevant articles based on the user's search query.
Example SQL code for retrieving articles by tag:
________________________________________________________________

SELECT * FROM articles WHERE tags LIKE '%health%'
________________________________________________________________
This SQL query would retrieve all articles that have the word "health" in the "tags" field. You can modify the query to search for other keywords or metadata fields as needed.

Example SQL code for retrieving articles by title:
________________________________________________________________

SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '%keyword%'
________________________________________________________________

This SQL query would retrieve all articles that have the word "keyword" in the "title" field. You can modify the query to search for other keywords or metadata fields as needed.
